The main input of the toolbox is an asynchronous log-price matrix:

Ylog_Nonsyn : T x N double

T : number of time points on the union time grid.

N : number of assets.

Entries are log-prices.

Missing observations must be encoded as 0, except that:

The first row in each column must be non-zero (the toolbox will
treat this as the initial log-price for that asset).

Rows where all N entries are zero are interpreted as time
instants with no trades for any asset; those rows are dropped
internally when building the linear system.

The toolbox constructs:

A large, sparse constraint matrix A based on observed durations.

A stacked vector b of observed increments over durations.

A "synchronously filled" panel obtained by forward-filling prices
within each asset, and uses its returns as an input to the PCA
initializer and the ADMM solver.
